# wtf is zk: a hands-on coding workshop

If you missed the workshop, you should still be able to do and understand everything by just exploring this repo.

In this workshop, we will 

- introduce zk and how it can contribute to privacy
- get an intuition for the different entities involved in zk, eg the prover and the verifier
- build a few circuits in Noir
- generate and verify proofs with both nargo (CLI) and noirjs (JavaScript)
- generate & deploy a solidity verifier to verify proofs onchain

## What's in this repo?

Go through each directory from step 1 to step 5. You'll start by learning the basics of Noir, then more intermeiate things, and finally verifying proofs onchain.

- [Step 1: a simple circuit (also find installation instructions here)](./step1/README.md)
- [Step 2: exploring types and hashing in Noir](./step2/README.md)
- [Step 3: unconstrained functions and optimizing circuits](./step3/README.md)
- [Step 4: proving and verifying in noirjs](./step4/README.md)
- [Step 5: verifying proofs onchain](./step5/README.md)
